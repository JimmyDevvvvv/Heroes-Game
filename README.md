#Clash of Clans: Heroes

#Project Overview

This project is a console-based strategy game built using Java, inspired by "Clash of Clans." It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a robust game engine that simulates a dynamic, turn-based environment. Players manage heroes, support units, and buildings while strategizing to defeat their opponents.

Features

1. Game Mechanics

Includes Palaces, Walls, Towers, and Barracks, each with distinct functionalities and upgrade paths.

2. Gameplay

Turn-Based Strategy:

Players alternate turns, managing units and buildings while executing strategies.

Resource Management:

Map Navigation:

Units move across a grid-based map, interacting with buildings and other units.

3. Interactions

Combat System:

Units and towers attack opponents based on range and action points.

Building Construction:

Heroes can construct towers and walls on specific map locations.

Adaptive AI:

The game ensures valid moves, enforces rules, and handles invalid actions with exceptions.

4. User Experience

Console Interface:

Simple yet engaging gameplay through the console.

Error Handling:

Robust exception handling for invalid moves and actions.
